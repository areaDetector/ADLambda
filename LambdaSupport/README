The files included in the directories libcommon and liblambda provide the source code for the low level driver 
provided with this detector.  These files are provided by 
  * X-Spectrum  http://www.x-spectrum.de/
  * DESY http://www.desy.de/
The developers of this camera.

The version of the drivers provided here are the working copy used to develop this driver for use with
EPICS areaDetector.  Up to date versions of the driver can be located here:
  * libcommon  https://stash.desy.de/projects/FSDSDET/repos/libcommon/browse
  * liblambda  https://stash.desy.de/projects/FSDSDET/repos/liblambda/browse
  
The development of this driver was aided by examination of the driver written by DESY for the Tango control
system (http://www.tango-controls.org/) 
  http://svn.code.sf.net/p/tango-ds/code/DeviceClasses/Acquisition/2D/Lambda/trunk/

  
The driver code provided here is uncompiled.  Instructions for compiling 
this driver are located in the INSTALL file located in the liblambda
directory.  Integration of this build with the EPICS build will be easiest 
if the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX described there is liblambda-$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).
