Installation instruction

1. Prerequists
-----------------
1.1) Library dependencies
-> libcommon
   This is part of the liblambda, compiling libcommon independently is unnecessary.
   source(git): https://stash.desy.de/scm/fsdsdet/libcommon.git

-> boost >= 1.41

1.2) Required build tool
-> gcc   >= 4.4.7
-> cmake >= 2.8.4

2. Build
-----------------
2.1) Create build directory
Once the source code is retrived, create a seperate build directy OUT OF souce directory.

$ mkdir liblamda-build
$ cd liblambda-build

2.2) Run cmake in build directory
Run cmake in build directory with the path of source directory as the input argument.

$ cmake /path/of/source/directory

The default value of the build type of the library is RELEASE. 
The build type can be changed by using CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE. 
The build type of this library can be either RELEASE or DEBUG. 

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG /path/of/source/directory

The default value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is /usr/local
The install prefix could also be changed by using CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. 

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/user-defined/install/path /path/of/source/directory

2.3) Run make
Once everything is configured successfully by cmake, run make and make install. 
The install path depends on the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX metioned before.

$ make
$ make install
