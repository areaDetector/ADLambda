Installation instruction

1. Prerequists
-----------------
1.1) Library dependencies
-> boost >= 1.55

1.2) Required build tool
-> gcc   >= 4.9.2
-> cmake >= 3.0.2

2. Build
-----------------
2.1) Clone source
Create new directory and clone source

$ mkdir detsoftware
$ cd detsoftware
$ git clone https://stash.desy.de/scm/fsdsdet/libfsdetcore.git

2.2) Create build directory
Once the source code is retrived, create a separate build directy OUT OF source directory.

$ mkdir libfsdetcore-build
$ cd libfsdetcore-build

2.3) Run cmake in build directory
Run cmake in build directory with the path of source directory as the input argument.

$ cmake /path/of/source/directory. Here : $ cmake ../libfsdetcore

The default value of the build type of the library is DEBUG. 
The build type can be changed by using CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE. 
The build type of this library can be either RELEASE or DEBUG. 

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE /path/of/source/directory

The default value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is /usr/local
The install prefix could also be changed by using CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. 

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/user-defined/install/path /path/of/source/directory

2.4) Run make
Once everything is configured successfully by cmake, run make and make install. 
The install path depends on the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX metioned before.

$ make
$ make install

2.5) add pkg config path
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}:/path/to/pkgconfigfile"
